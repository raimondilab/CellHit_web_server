                CellHit is a web server designed to provide detailed insights into patient cancer cell sensitivities to drugs.
                Using patient transcriptomic data, CellHit predicts drug sensitivities leveraging data from the GDSC and PRISM assays, enabling opportunities for targeted therapies and precision oncology.
                The platform integrates the computational pipeline from <Link to="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56827-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b><i> Learning and actioning general principles of cancer cell drug sensitivity</i></b></Link>, enhancing accessibility to state-of-the-art methods.
                CellHit also offers an extensive suite of tools for aligning, visualizing, and modeling patient cancer cells alongside well-characterized commercial cell lines.
                Crucially, the webserver abstracts away the necessity to set up the required running environment and most of the needed pre-processing and harmonization steps.
                Additionally, the web server allows users to explore pre-computed predictions and outputs for the entire TCGA dataset.

                The UMAP scatterplot consists of aligned sample transcriptomic RNA-seq data. To enable a quick qualitative assessment of the aligned data, the server generates a low-dimensional projection using parametric-UMAP mapping. This projection maps the incoming data within the pre-existing aligned transcriptomics spaces of the TCGA and CCLE datasets, providing contextualization against established datasets. The data is displayed in an interactive scatterplot, allowing users to visualize metadata associated with transcriptomic neighbors in the space.

                Users can access additional information by clicking on a specific prediction row in the table, including a graph displaying the top 15 genes ranked by their absolute SHAP importance. In this graph, blue bars represent genes that lower the IC50 value (indicating increased drug sensitivity). In contrast, red bars represent genes that raise the IC50 value (indicating decreased sensitivity).
                <br/>Additionally, we utilize kernel density estimation (KDE) plots to visualize two complementary distributional features of the predictions. The first plot compares a drug's predicted response to that of other drugs tested on the same cell line; a red line on the left side of the distribution indicates higher efficacy. The second plot examines the drug's behaviour across multiple cell lines, helping to identify instances where consistently low IC50 values may suggest general toxicity instead of selective effectiveness. <br/>Click the replay icon to reset the selection and hide the SHAP plot and distribution plots.

                A heatmap provides an overview of drug sensitivity profiles, with samples represented as rows and drugs as columns. Responses are calculated using two normalization methods: Median Subtraction and Standardization.
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li  class="fs-1 text-justify">Median Subtraction: This method adjusts predictions by subtracting the median value for each drug (from either GDSC or PRISM). It indicates whether a sample shows higher sensitivity (highlighted in blue, below the median) or lower sensitivity (indicated in red, above the median). This approach is useful for assessing drug specificity.</li>
                <li  class="fs-1 text-justify">Standardization: This method normalizes values by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the processed samples. It emphasizes the relative differences between samples, making it particularly useful for identifying distinct tumor subtypes and potential applications in precision medicine.</li>
             </ul>
             <p className="fs-1 text-justify">By incorporating response information and applying hierarchical clustering to the rows, we can simplify the grouping of patients with similar response patterns. Both rows and columns are clustered based on predicted sensitivities, which helps group drugs and samples with identical response profiles. This clustering aids in identifying subgroups of patients with unique sensitivity characteristics.

Additionally, any drug with an average ln(IC50) value lower than -1 is included in the selection.</p>
